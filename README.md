# Another Lab? 
Unfortunately I keep putting this off. I understand the importance of documentation, yet I either run out of time, or just simply get too lazy to document what I am doing in my lab. Over the past year, I have attempted to learn the ways of DevOps. Today while scrolling through LinkedIn, I ran into the  [Homelab Almanac](https://taggartinstitute.org/p/the-homelab-almanac) that was written by Michael Taggart. 

A lot of this lab will be based off of the materials listed above as well as some other techniques I may pick up and want to test along the way.
