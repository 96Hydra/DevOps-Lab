# Jumpbox configuration 

This will be the access to our internal lab enviroment from our LAN connection. From here, we are going to configure port forwarding to allow RDP/SSH access into this jumpbox which will then grant
us access to other lab resources. This will also give us an internal presence to access our router's web UI.

# OS Selection

For our OS we are going to use KDE Neon. We're just going to copy the link and install it directly from the link as opposed to downloading it to our local machine. 

# Hardware Config 

We're going to allocate this guy 8 GB of RAM, 4 cores, and about 50 GB of storage. Feel free to scale up/down as needed for your own enviroment.
